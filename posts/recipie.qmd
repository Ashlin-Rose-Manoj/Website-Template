Ingredients:
For Marination:
1 kg chicken (preferably with bones)
1 cup yogurt
1.5 tsp red chili powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
2 tbsp ginger garlic paste
1 tsp garam masala powder
Salt to taste
2 tbsp lemon juice
For Rice:
2 cups basmati rice
4 cups water
1 bay leaf
4 cloves
2 cardamom pods
1 cinnamon stick
Salt to taste
For Biryani:
2 large onions, thinly sliced
1/2 cup ghee or oil
1/4 cup milk
A pinch of saffron
Fresh coriander and mint leaves, chopped
2 green chilies, slit
Instructions:
Marinate the Chicken:
In a large bowl, mix yogurt, red chili powder, turmeric powder, ginger garlic paste, garam masala powder, salt, and lemon juice.
Add the chicken pieces and coat them well with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
Prepare the Rice:
Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes.
In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Add bay leaf, cloves, cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, and salt.
Add the soaked rice and cook until it‚Äôs 70% done. Drain the rice and set aside.
Fry the Onions:
Heat ghee or oil in a large pan. Add the sliced onions and fry until they are golden brown and crispy. Remove and set aside.
Layer the Biryani:
In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread a layer of marinated chicken at the bottom.
Add a layer of partially cooked rice over the chicken.
Sprinkle fried onions, chopped coriander, mint leaves, and slit green chilies.
Repeat the layers until all the chicken and rice are used up.
Soak saffron in warm milk and drizzle it over the top layer of rice.
Dum Cooking:
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam inside.
Cook on low heat for about 30-40 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and the rice is tender.
Serve:
Gently fluff up the biryani with a fork, ensuring the layers remain intact.
Serve hot with raita or your favorite side dish.
